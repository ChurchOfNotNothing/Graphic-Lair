# Setting-Up
## Something Simple ::: Detailed Designing For the Future which is now

This is my first time and I'm a super noob so forgive me if this isn't done properly.

### Goal

- Complete a vector design with heavy styling that will scale to any size.
- Make something that looks new
- Start with something very complex to show a robust use of skills working in tandem
