### Goal
- Complete a vector design with heavy styling that will scale to any size.
- Make something that looks new but could be real
- Create a design with complexity to show a robust use of skills working in tandem

### Process
- Draw vector shapes with the pen tool in Adobe Photoshop
- Tighten up the vector shapes a bit but still leaving it a bit natural so that it looks hand-made
- Add styling to the vector layers using emboss, gradients, patterns, layer blending, and shadows
- For fun make a rasterized merge copy on top to create a few lens flares and set opacity
- Create the background for detailing depth
- Make alternate version to manipulate saturation and lighting for an authentic look

I have included my source file so that anyone can download the .PSD to examine the details of each layer and how they are styled. In the Github respository named: HouseOrigami.b1

Thanks for the look....this is my first time and I'm definitely a super noob. So, forgive me if this isn't completed properly.
